#the below is code that finds the energy use of an EV based on the ambient temperature, according to published data
#(including that from this author from Alaska EVs, see: A Global Daily Solar Photovoltaic Load 
#Coverage Factor Map for Passenger Electric Vehicles, M Wilber, E Whitney, C Haupert, 2022 IEEE PES/IAS PowerAfrica, 1-4
#From this paper, the relationship between relative efficiency and T for passenger cars is: RE = .000011T^3 + .00045T^2 - 0.038T + 1.57, T in C

#from some preliminary north slope Lightning data we have, it seems that the higher order terms/slope does not scale with the EPA rated
#efficiency, just the intercept.  This makes sense as the cabin size to heat is similar to a car (the battery is bigger though,
#so it might require more heat?) anyway, the below fits the data we have from the truck better:

#carrying through the math:
tmy['EpM_T'] = .0000027*tmy['T_C']**3 + .00011*tmy['T_C']**2 - 0.0093*tmy['T_C'] + epm * 1.37
